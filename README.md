# Getting ready for finals

1. Select a time slot for your final oral presentation at [Presentation Time slot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HrApQ2KHJcj4GnpPXSNZbmDIMrM7V-XsLmsNoIIyYE8/edit#gid=796203822).

2. This repository consists of two main `R Markdown` files such as:

   * Final report and
   * Oral Presentation.  
  
3. Submit all source files (including `.Rmd` files) as a **team** just before your oral presentation (January 29, 2022 or January 30, 2022).

4. Make final project repository public and deploy your final report at GitHub pages (you have to do
required actions before publishing).

5. Under **About** section (top-right) of your repo, on the **topics** bar, type your data source and most commonly used packages such as 
"UNDP, ggplot2" so that other people can find your repo on GitHub.

6. Please provide url address of your final project deployed at GitHub pages
in this [Google Sheet form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HrApQ2KHJcj4GnpPXSNZbmDIMrM7V-XsLmsNoIIyYE8/edit#gid=0).

7. The address should be similar to this: https://github.com/MAT381E-Fall21/final-project_teamname.
